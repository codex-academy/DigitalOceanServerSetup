# chose image size

<p><code>03</code>.You should chose the cheapest image with less space which is going to be 20GB and each project isn't going to even exceed 100MegaBytes, otherwise you can upgrade your droplet. You could get your droplet up and running again without losing your stuff hence all files are safe only when a backup is created.</p>
