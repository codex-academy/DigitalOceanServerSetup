Once you have selected all of your preferred options,<code>08</code>. click on "Create".


After your Droplet is created, its root password will arrive in your email inbox and the Droplet will be set up. If you included an SSH key in the previous steps, you will not be emailed a root password â€” use your SSH private key to authenticate as the root user instead.

:smiley: With that, your server is ready !
