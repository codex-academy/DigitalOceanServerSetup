# 5.Install Nginx

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

Nginx (pronounced "engine x") is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server.

Following the steps below will show you how to install Nginx and test its functionality. Be sure to follow our more advanced how-to on configuring virtual hosts afterwards, which will give you the ability to serve multiple websites from your (VPS) Server.

<h3>Install Nginx with command</h3>

`VirtualPrivateServer`$`apt-get install nginx`

By default, Nginx will not start automatically, so you need to use the following command. Other valid options are `stop` and `restart`.
 To restart we need to run the following command:

 <input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox">
`VirtualPrivateServer`$`sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start`

<h3>The results should be like the following.</h3>

* `Starting nginx`:

configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful nginx.
