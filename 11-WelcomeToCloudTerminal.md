# Welcome yourself to the Cloud-Computing.

<h2>The Basic flow of Digital Ocean's sequence</h2>

Here we will be executing commands.
Where?
# So we are having two Main keys

# KEYS

* Virtual Machine - `VirtualPrivateServer`$

* Physical Machine -`LocalMachine`$


Whenever you see `VirtualPrivateServer`$ you should know that the command after the `$` should be run on the `Virtual Machine` and with `LocalMachine`$ should then indicate that you are going to run the command next to the DOLLAR SIGN(`$`) on your right hand side to your `Physical computer`.
